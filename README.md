    - simple require check will do the job
- [x] handling the floats
    - float operations will happen in oracle
- [ ] solution for returning UserInfo struct for frontend
- [x] managing fees and their acquisition during stake and harvest
    - needs some polishing but its done
- [ ] burning
- [x] exploit in unstake function
