# Contributing 

## How to make a good PR
 - Attach the description, explain what and why are you changing
 - Don't make huge PR's, it must be easily readable by lead devs in short time
 - Make sure it works, don't push arbitrarily

## Code sanity
 - Attach documentations
 - Attach tests
 - You aren't sure if it works? make new branch under `broken-feature` name
 - Don't tryhard, write simple code
